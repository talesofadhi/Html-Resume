      <p>
        Hi! I'm Adithyan Satheesh, a passionate and self-driven Web Developer
        currently pursuing a B.Sc. in Mathematics at St. Berchmans College. I
        began my journey into tech shortly after completing my higher secondary
        education at St. Berchmans Higher Secondary School, where I developed a
        strong foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving. Today, I
        proudly run my own software company as a Sole Proprietor, developing
        solutions that make a difference — including a recent custom-built
        application for care homes, designed to streamline management and
        improve care standards. With a sharp eye for detail and a dedication to
        clean, scalable code, I’m constantly learning, building, and innovating.
        Whether it's front-end design or back-end logic, I aim to create web
        experiences that are both functional and beautiful.
      </p>
